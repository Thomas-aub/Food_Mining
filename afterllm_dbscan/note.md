- using recipes truncated after llm give no changes on clutering with diffrent methods, comparing with before llm version
- using directly vocab -> Without recipe-ingredient associations, you cannot do meaningful clustering because:
	1.	No co-occurrence data: You don’t know which ingredients appear together in recipes
	2.	No similarity metric: Can’t measure if “tomato” and “basil” are related (they often co-occur in Italian recipes)
	3.	Each ingredient is isolated: Your current matrix is essentially  n_ingredients × 1  (each ingredient appears once), not  n_ingredients × n_recipes 
This is why all clustering methods failed — there’s literally no structure to discover!
